# 1.2 破题 + 小分论点思路

破题三思路：
1. 为什么
2. 逻辑终点
3. 逻辑起点



理由说：
#### 1.题目本身包含两点
两点可直接作为两个TS或一个TS的分论点

例：
```
The opinions of celebrities, such as entertainers or ethletes, are more important to the younger people than they are to the older people.
```

opinion  ==> younger

TS1:opinion -> student  
    a.entertainer:fation  
    b.etheletes:persistance
    


TS2:opinion -> younger employees  
    a.entertainer:marrige  
    b.exercise
    
    
#### 2.利益双方65%  should 
例：
``` 
An effective leader should try to make others feel that they are part of the decision making process.
```

Decision =》good   

TS1:decision -> leader  
    a.wider decision    
    b.less pressure     

    
TS2:decision -> good for employees  
    a.time management   
    b.efficient 
    

#### 3.方面说/维度说

切B 或 切A  
例：
```
honest is an important characteristic that a person should have in order to be successful in workspace.
```


跑题：  
1.只要出现key owrds, 就不跑题  
2.把题目写全（从句）  
3.题目读细



特殊题型：  
##### 1.三选一题型  
要有对比 

分别对比其他两个选项

##### 2.极端题  

一般写反对  
和题目观点进行对比   

例：
```
The best way for a teacher to let let student become interested in a subject is to help them know how to use it in their lives ouside school.
```
Disagree   
TS1:teaching aids -> interest  > outside  
    a.slide  
    b.models  
    
TS2:increase involvement -> interest >outside  
    a.presentation  
    b.group discussion  
    

3.问现象？  (涵盖古今对比题)  
解题：  
1.现象产生的原因（理由说）  
2.用现象说现象（方面说）

例：
```
more and more people are spending money on their pets, even though there can be other good ways to spend money.
```
Agree(现象产生原因)

TS1:pets->isolation  
    a.converse with other owners.   
    b.companision
    
TS2:pets->reduce tension  
    a.amuse 
    b.provide an distraction from daily worries.
