# 口语技巧


## 通用 


大篇幅使用例子
例子尽量详细。如：
	Allen Iverson, the NBA superstar, is definitely one of the people for whom I have a huge admiration. I admire him a lot because he is such a hard-working guy that you would feel like there’s nothing he cannot do. Once I watched an interview of his coach in high school on NBC. He said that Allen was just super diligent. He was always the first person that arrived for the training, and always the last one to leave. He usually stayed for another 2 hours after all his teammates left for dinner. So it’s definitely his hard work that made him one of the most phenomenal players in the league.

使用熟悉的单词 , 短语 , 和句型。


结尾时应尽量避免说出像 That’s all. 或者是 Thank you. 之类的表达.


讲述重点放在听力内容。

综合信息，不使用 “In the reading materials, .... In the listening material, ....”类似表达。


## Task 1

## Task 3
六个信息点

1. 学校计划做什么
2. 学校计划做这件事的第一个原因 
3. 学校计划做这件事的第二个原因

1. 学生是同意 / 反对学校的计划
2. 学生同意 / 反对学校计划的第一个原因

例子：

The university is planning to spend a huge amount of money on building a new sports complex because they want to draw the attention from more high-level students. And also, they are really hoping to strengthen the tie between the university and the local community. But the woman thinks it’s a terrible idea. She thinks that spending money in such places as the library and cafeteria, which top students obviously care more about, is a much better choice compared with wasting it on building sports complex. Besides, it’s not going to help strengthen the relationship because people didn’t come to games because they hated to watch the teams losing, not because there weren’t enough seats.
## Task 4

总结听力中例子或应用的时候 , 应当首先抓住核心信息


专有名词可以用 a kind of plant”和 “a kind of bird”之类的短语表达



例：
The professor is talking about a psychological concept called perceptual constancy, which refers to the phenomenon that even as conditions change and we see objects differently, we still recognize that they remain the same. And he gives us two examples to illustrate this concept. In the first case, if you hold a kitchen plate right in front of your face, it’s a perfect circle. But if you tilt it into a horizontal position, it becomes an oval. So we can see that the shape of the plate changes, but because of the concept of perceptual constancy, we don’t think we have two plates, do we? In the second example, if you sit in a front row in the classroom, the professor looks bigger, but if you sit in a back row, he will look much smaller. Although the professor seems to have different sizes in the two situations, again, because of perceptual constancy, we know he’s the same person


## Task 6

应当花更多的时间去讲述听力中的例子 , 而不是概念 

例：
The professor is talking about two factors that helped increase connections among Americans in the US history. The first factor is the mass production of automobiles. When automobiles became inexpensive, people from small towns could travel easily to cities or to other parts of the country, and when they began to do this, they started acting like people from those regions and started to dress and speak in the same way. The second factor is the drammatic increase in radio ownership. When radio became popular, people from different areas began listening to the same programs and news reports and began to speak alike and have similar experiences and ideas.
